 1. Explain Life cycle in Class Component and functional component with Hooks

ANS.The mounting phase is when a new component is created and inserted into the DOM or,
      in other  words, when the life of a component begins. This can only happen once, and 
      is often called “initial render.”

    The updating phase is when the component updates or re-renders. This reaction is 
     triggered when the props are updated or when the state is updated. This phase can
     occur multiple times, which is kind of the point of React.

   The last phase within a component's lifecycle is the unmounting phase, when the 
     component is removed from the DOM.
